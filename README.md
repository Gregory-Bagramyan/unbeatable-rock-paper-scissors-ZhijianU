Zhijian University conducted an experimental research among 360 students and each one played 300 rounds of rock pqper scissors.
Their discovery (the really simple version at least) is that : 
- If a player win a round he or she is more likely the reproduce the same choice in the next round.
For example : if a player wins with rock he or she is more likely to play rock again on the next round.
- If a player loses a round he or she is more likely to make a different choice on the next round.
For example if a player loses with rock he or she is more likely the not plqy rock on the next round and 
thus will play paper or scissors
