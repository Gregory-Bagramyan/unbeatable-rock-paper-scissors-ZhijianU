Play rock paper scissors against the strategy based on the Zhijian University research.

Here is a python terminal rock paper scissors game, were a player (you) can play against a bot which follows the strategy based on the Zhijian University research.
run the command  python rock_paper_scissors_zhijian_uni.py to play the game (or python3 rock_paper_scissors_zhijian_uni.py if you encounter an error)

Zhijian University conducted an experimental research among 360 students and each one played 300 rounds of rock pqper scissors.
Their discovery (the really simple version at least) is that : 
- If a player win a round he or she is more likely the reproduce the same choice in the next round.
For example : if a player wins with rock he or she is more likely to play rock again on the next round.
- If a player loses a round he or she is more likely to make a different choice on the next round.
For example if a player loses with rock he or she is more likely the not plqy rock on the next round and 
thus will play paper or scissors
